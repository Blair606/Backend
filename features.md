1.1Research Background 
The rapid adoption of online education has become a hallmark of modern learning, significantly accelerated by the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, educational institutions have increasingly embraced digital platforms such as Moodle, Google Classroom, and Blackboard to enhance course management, foster student engagement, and streamline assessment processes (Miller et al., 2020). However, these platforms often fall short in addressing the unique challenges faced by specific institutions like Pwani University in Kilifi County, Kenya.
Pwani University operates within a socio-economic context characterized by financial instability, where many students struggle to pay their school fees on time. This financial burden restricts their ability to fully engage with the institution's e-learning resources. According to a recent survey conducted at Pwani University, over 60% of students reported delays in accessing course materials due to unpaid fees, emphasizing the crucial link between financial stability and educational accessibility (Sifuna, 2021). Such financial challenges create a reliance on alternative solutions like Zoom, but the inconsistent use of various platforms disrupts the learning experience. Students find it difficult to keep track of their classes and access necessary materials, resulting in increased stress and confusion, ultimately contributing to lower academic performance.
Moreover, parental engagement plays a vital role in supporting students' academic journeys, particularly in monitoring educational progress and financial obligations. At Pwani University, this engagement is often hampered by a lack of transparency regarding students' academic performance and financial standing. Many parents remain unaware of their children's situations until significant discrepancies emerge during graduation (Musau, 2020). This disconnect has implications for trust and accountability; instances of students misusing funds intended for tuition have been reported, complicating parental oversight. Strengthening communication channels between the university and parents is essential for promoting accountability. Keeping parents informed about their children's academic progress and financial transactions is critical to ensuring that students receive the necessary support to succeed. This collaborative approach can foster an environment that not only benefits parents and students but also enhances the educational experience at Pwani University.
1.2 Research Problem.
 At Pwani University, there exists a significant gap in parental engagement and student accessibility within the online learning environment. This project aims to develop a robust online learning platform that not only improves academic access for students but also fosters active parental involvement, thereby enhancing overall educational outcomes and support systems for students.
1.3Problem justification.
The necessity for a comprehensive online learning platform at Pwani University is underscored by the need for improved parental engagement and enhanced student accessibility. Research indicates that active parental involvement is positively correlated with student academic success; however, many parents currently lack transparency regarding their children's academic performance and financial obligations. Additionally, students face significant barriers in accessing educational resources due to the inability to pay school fees on time, which restricts their engagement with the university’s learning system. By integrating a system that fosters communication between parents and the university while also addressing financial constraints, this project aims to create a supportive educational environment that enhances student outcomes and accountability.
1.4Objectives of the research

ii.What essential features and functionalities do students and lecturers need for an interactive and user-friendly web-based learning platform?
iii.How can the impact of the web-based learning platform on student learning outcomes and satisfaction be measured?
1.6Assumptions
Technological Proficiency: It is assumed that students and lecturers possess sufficient technological proficiency to navigate the web-based learning platform, although some lecturers may require training to effectively set up and manage online classes. However, this assumption may overlook varying levels of comfort with technology among users.
Internet Access: It is assumed that students will have reliable access to Wi-Fi or mobile data for attending classes. This assumption acknowledges potential variability in internet connectivity among students, which could impact their ability to participate fully in the online learning environment.
Health Issues: It is assumed that health issues related to screen time, such as eye strain and back pain, will not significantly affect student engagement. This assumption may not account for the diverse health conditions and personal circumstances of students that could influence their learning experience.
Technical Support: It is assumed that the university will provide adequate technical support for the web-based learning platform. While this is a necessary condition for success, it may not fully consider the potential limitations in resources or response times that could affect user experience.
